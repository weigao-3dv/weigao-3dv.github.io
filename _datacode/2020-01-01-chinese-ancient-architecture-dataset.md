##  Chinese Ancient Architecture Image Database

The following datasets are currently available for non-commercial use. The datasets have two parts, one part consists of laser scan data and corresponding image data which used to compare the accuracy and completeness with the different reconstruction methods, the other consists of the image collections of the typical ancient architectures in the four Buddhist mountains (Mount Wutai, Mount Emei, Mount Jiuhua, Mount Putuo) and two Taoist mountains (Mount Wudang, Mount Qingcheng).

### Benchmark Database

We use the Riegl-LMS-Z420i laser scanner to scan the 3 buildings in the Tsinghua University. The scanner's accuracy is 10mm@50m, and the angular stepwidth is 0.0057degree. The 3 buildings are the old gate, the tsinghua school, and the life science building. You can download the groundtruth data from laser scanner, the image data and the camera projection matrix of each buildings. And you can also obtain the evaluation software which is used to evaluate the difference between your result and the groundtruth in Software section.
